1. This version works but it outputs text like this 
Text(annotations=[], value='The')The dataset contains several columns, 
including one for the submission date (SubmitDate) and a column indicating 
whether the deal was funded (funded).

To determine how many deals were funded in 2024, 
I'll filter the dataset for records where the SubmitDate falls within the year 2024 and 
the funded column indicates that the deal was funded (with a value of 1). Let's carry out this analysis.
Text(annotations=[], value='A')A total of 64 deals were funded in 2024.
